    <p> 
      Today so far I started organizing my time for what I 
      want to do up to January 1, 2022.  I also did some errands 
      at home.

    <p> 
      I plan to work at least 4 hours today on Amazon Technical 
      Academy application related work and to continue running 
      errands.
